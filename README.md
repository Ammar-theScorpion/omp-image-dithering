# omp-image-dithering
image-dithering is a method used to reduce the color depth of an image while minimizing the loss of detail. It works by replacing the colors in an image with colors from a limited palette, using an algorithm to determine which colors are the best match for the original colors. This technique is often used in image processing and computer graphics to create the illusion of more colors or shades in an image, or to reduce the file size of an image by using fewer colors. Omp-image-dithering can be useful in situations where an image needs to be displayed on a device with a limited number of colors, or where the image needs to be transmitted over a low-bandwidth connection
